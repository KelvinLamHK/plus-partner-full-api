Dear Sheeta,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I won't be able to come to the office today due to flu and fever. Currently, I am still running a fever and coughing, and I believe it's best for me not to be at the office to avoid spreading the illness to others.

However, I will be working from home to ensure that our project progresses smoothly. I understand the time constraints we are facing, and I will do my best to catch up on the work. I will keep contact with Jack and Jacky.

Attached is my certificate.

Thank you for your understanding during this time.

Best regards,
Kelvin Lam
